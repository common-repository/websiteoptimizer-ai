Easily integrate WebsiteOptimizer.AI to automatically optimize your website's content using AI and A/B testing.

== Description ==

WebsiteOptimizer.AI Integration plugin allows you to seamlessly add the WebsiteOptimizer.AI script to your WordPress site.

WebsiteOptimizer.AI lets you select parts of your WordPress site to optimize using LLM AIs (large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 or Anthropic's Claude). It rewrites your content based on your goals and then A/B tests different variations to see which one performs best. Over time, it will automatically replace poorly performing variations with better performing variations.

Think of it like Google Optimize, but with content variations created automatically with AI.

Key features:
- Easy installation and configuration
- No coding required
- Automatically optimize your website's content using AI
- A/B test different variations of your content
- Select a variety of goals including engagement, time on site and conversions (a conversion being a visit to specific page like a purchase confirmation page)

This plugin relies on the WebsiteOptimizer.AI to optimize your website's content. When activated, the plugin will send page view data to WebsiteOptimizer.AI servers. This may be via either the domain <websiteoptimizer.ai> or our API domain <websiteoptimizer.dev>.
